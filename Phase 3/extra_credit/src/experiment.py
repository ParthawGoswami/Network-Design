Author: Joseph Nguyen
Description: Automates experiments for sender-driven RDT 3.0.
For each option (1â€“5) and for loss rates from 0% to 60% (in 5% increments),
it runs 5 trials, averages the completion time (and other metrics), and writes
one averaged row per condition to performance_data.csv.
Usage:
    python experiment.py
Ensure that the server is running before starting the experiments.
